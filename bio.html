                <p>Gordon Moore was born in San Francisco in 1929<sup><a class="citation"
                            href="references.html#cite-2">2</a></sup>. As a
                    child, Moore became interested in chemistry<sup><a class="citation"
                            href="references.html#cite-3">3</a></sup> ,
                    eventually going on to earn a doctorate in physical chemistery At the California Institute of
                    Technology<sup><a class="citation" href="references.html#cite-3">3</a></sup>. After earning his PhD,
                    Moore's first job at Shockley Semiconductor was a disappointment to him<sup><a class="citation"
                            href="references.html#cite-3">3</a></sup> and
                    after a short time, he and some colleagues - who were called the "traitorous eight" at the
                    time<sup><a class="citation" href="references.html#cite-4">4</a></sup> - left to found Fairchild
                    Semiconductor in 1957<sup><a class="citation" href="references.html#cite-3">3</a></sup>. In 1965,
                    while still at Fairchild, that Moore postulated what later came to be called <a

                            href="references.html#cite-5">5</a></sup>. Three years later, he
                    left Fairchild and helped found the Intel Corporation<sup><a class="citation"
                            href="references.html#cite-6">6</a></sup>. Moore retired from the Intel corporation in
                    2001<sup><a class="citation" href="references.html#cite-3">3</a></sup>.</p>

                <p>The Intel Corporation was founded in 1968 by Robert Noyce and Gordon Moore<sup><a class="citation"
                            href="references.html#cite-7">7</a></sup>. Initially, Intel produced memory chips. They
                    started with the relatively unsuccessful but revolutionary 1101, and followed that with the vastly
                    more successful 1-kilobyte DRAM chip, the 1103<sup><a class="citation"
                            href="references.html#cite-7">7</a></sup>. Over the years, Intel's product met with mixed
                    success. It was in 1978 that Intel's true ascendancy began. That year, Intel released the 16-bit
                    8086 processor, the ancestor of the later Pentium series and today's Core series of
                    processors<sup><a class="citation" href="references.html#cite-7">7</a></sup>. With the 8086
                    processor came the x86 instruction set which has been extended and built on for 40 years and is
                    still used today<sup><a class="citation" href="references.html#cite-8">8</a></sup>.</p>

                <p>As mentioned above, <a href="moores-law.html">Moore's law</a> was put forth in 1965 by Gordon Moore.
                    Originally, Moore estimated that the density of components in an integrated circuit would double
                    every year. He adjusted his prediction in 1975 to every two years<sup><a class="citation"
                            href="references.html#cite-9">9</a></sup>. As can be seen in the graph to the right, this
                    prediction has been roughly correct for the last 40+ years.</p>
