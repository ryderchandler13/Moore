                <p>Moore's Law was proposed in 1965 as an observation by Gordon Moore<sup><a class="citation"
                            href="references.html#cite-5">5</a></sup>, then employed by Fairchild
                    Semiconductor. Initially, Moore estimated that the number of components in an integration circuit
                    would double every year. He later changed his estimate to every two years. In practice, the doubling
                    has occurred roughly every 18 months<sup><a class="citation"
                            href="references.html#cite-10">10</a></sup>, as shown in the graph to the right.</p>
                <p>Today, some engineers, including the CEO of the NVidia corporation, are predicting that the progress
                    predicted by Moore's Law must soon come to an end<a class="citation"
                        href="references.html#cite-11">11</a></sup>. The current incredibly small size of transistors
                    has begun to come up against the laws of physics, which results in electrons moving unexpectedly to
                    places they should not be. Denser circuits also produce more heat and consume more power, which is
                    why current processors increasingly add cores rather than more components.</p>
                <p>If Moore's Law does begin to falter, it will fall to software engineers to write more efficient
                    software to leverage existing power more effectively, rather that rely on always getting more
                    processing power year after year<a class="citation" href="references.html#cite-11">11</a></sup>. As
                    software engineers, this presents an interesting challenge as we move forward in the industry.
                    Increasing software efficiency is a like solving a puzzle. All the pieces of any particular piece of
                    software must be rearranged and optimized in ways the original author had probably not considered.
